# blinkit
Linux GUI for viewing Blink videos

This desktop program makes it easier to view Blink videos that you've copied to your computer.

As it stands its coded to use SMPlayer.

The funky dates on the mp4 files are converted to your timezone and a 12-hour format.

It DOES still require you to remove the USB drive from the Sync-2 module  and transfer the "blink" video folder to a folder on your computer...

Select video from list and click "Play"  
Or, double-click the video from the list.
